> I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.  
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.   
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate.   
All those...moments will be lost in time, like tears...in rain.   
Time to die.

The quote describes what a gorgeous life could be, what I could be pursuing for the whole life. New year begins, conventionally it's a time for people to make self-reflections for the passed year and to look forward to the new year. And, what should not be left behind, is making resolutions for the new year.   


For me, my 2018â€˜s resolutions are to finish those that were not accomplished in 2017 which should have been achieved in 2016 whose origins can be traced back to 2015â€™s resolutions that were made up in 2014 and did not go well in 2013...ðŸ˜‚  

Just kidding,ðŸ™ƒ here are the real ones:

In 2017, job was great, I learned pretty a lot technically, grew up to a real software engineer. I shall say thanks to [Hyancat](https://github.com/hyancat), who is a professional engineer that actually teached me what a professional commerical software engineering procedure could be. Learned a lot in 2017, mostly basic computer science, iOS development stuffs and commerical software engineering. Now I am in Dublin, study AI course in Trinity College.

Resolutions in 2018:

| Aim | desciption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI and Machine Learning. | Duty for master study, what I come for. |
| Re-study advanced mathematics. | I regret that I didn't master it when I am an  undergraduate. I am starting to recognize the beauty and elegance of math. |
| Practise in [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com) | Algorithm! Algorithm! Math! Math! Also useful for technical interviews. | 
| Compiler Principles| I've alway been wanting to know the secret behind compiler. With sufficient math knowledge, time to start. | 
| Entry-level Web Development| Web is a prosperous field and it is the potential future to unite all platfroms.|
| Elementary finance & economics| It's optional, depends on time. I do want the abilities of undertanding fiancial indices, news and reports. |
